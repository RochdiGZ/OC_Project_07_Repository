Project 07: Solve problems using algorithms in Python

The steps to follow to run the main program :

    I. Preparation of the project environment
        1. Download and install Python version 3.10
            1.1.  Download Python 3.10 using the URL https://www.python.org/downloads/ and

            1.2.  Click the download link
            1.3.  Install this version of Python that has the venv module. However, version < 3.3 does not have venv.
        2. Download and install the latest version of Git (Package Version Manager)
            2.1.  Download the latest version of Git using the URL https://git-scm.com/downloads/
                  and choosing your Windows, macOS or Linux/Unix system
            2.2.  Click the download link
            2.3.  Install this version of Git that has a Git Bash terminal
        3. Download and install the latest version of PyCharm
            3.1.  Download the latest version of PyCharm using the URL https://www.jetbrains.com/en-us/pycharm/
            3.2.  Click the Download button
            3.3.  Choose your Windows, macOS or Linux/Unix system
            3.4.  Click the Download button of the Community free version for pure Python development
            3.5.  Install this version of PyCharm which has Git: package version manager.
                  PyCharm also has a PS (PowerShell) terminal similar to the "Windows PowerShell" terminal

    II. Creating a virtual environment (e.g. env) using "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal

        1.  Run "Pycharm" or "Git Bash" to access its terminal
        2.  Navigate to your project folder (P07, for example) that has already been created by running the command:
                cd P07
        3.  Type and run the command below to create a new virtual environment named env:
                python -m venv env

    III. Activation and Deactivation virtual environment using "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal

        1.  Activation under MacOS or Linux/Unix of the virtual environment using the "Git Bash" terminal by running:
                source env/bin/activate
        2.  Activate the virtual environment on Windows using the "Git Bash" terminal by running the command:
                source ./env/Scripts/activate
        3.  Activation under Windows of the virtual environment using the "PyCharm" terminal by running the command:
                env/Scripts/activate

            In case the virtual environment has not been activated, you can run, before activation, the command:
                Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
            So, you can use these two links to help you solve this problem:

        4.  Deactivate the virtual environment using the "Git Bash" or "PyCharm" terminal by running the command:
                deactivate
